## Description
 This aixautomation Puppet module has been developed against Puppet 5.3.3, and has been 
  tested against Puppet 5.3.3 and Puppet 5.3.5.<br>  
 This aixautomation Puppet module enables automation of software maintenance operations 
  on a list of AIX LPARs, by running this module on a NIM server managing these LPARs.<br>
 By software maintenance operations we mean : updates of AIX levels, updates of efix.<br>   
 Necessary AIX level updates are automatically downloaded from FixCentral using 'suma' 
  features, and are locally kept and shared between LPARs if possible.<br>
 Downloaded updates can then be automatically applied on a list of LPARs, through 'nim push' 
  operations, therefore everything (i.e. all aixautomation logic) runs from the NIM server, 
  and nothing needs to be installed on LPARs themselves.<br>
 List of necessary efix is computed (for each LPAR) and retrieved using 'flrtvc', 
  downloaded, kept locally (in a local repository of the system where this Puppet module 
  runs), and they are kept in a way they can be shared between LPARs. Each LPAR has its 
  own list of efix to be applied, depending on its level and depending on the current list 
  of efix already applied. Theses efix are then applied on each LPAR of the list 
  (after being sorted by 'PACKAGING DATE' : so that most recent ones are applied first). 
  This operation is done by using NIM push mode (therefore as already said without performing 
  any operation on the LPARs themselves, therefore without installing anything on these LPARs). 

## Setup
### Setup Requirements 
 This aixautomation module needs to run a the NIM server which manages LPARs 
 to be updated, therefore Puppet needs to be installed and run on this NIM server. <br>
 This aixautomation module requires download access to FixCentral, and http/https/ftp 
  access to eFix download server.<br>  
 
### Setup Puppet 
 First of all, you'll need to install Puppet on your NIM server. <p>
 To run this aixautomation module, you only need Puppet running in a standalone way. <br>
 Download Puppet 5.3 from https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise :<br> 
  **- for AIX 7.2,7.1** : https://s3.amazonaws.com/puppet-agents/2017.3/puppet-agent/5.3.5/repos/aix/7.1/PC1/ppc/puppet-agent-5.3.5-1.aix7.1.ppc.rpm<br>
  **- for AIX 6.1** : https://s3.amazonaws.com/puppet-agents/2017.3/puppet-agent/5.3.5/repos/aix/6.1/PC1/ppc/puppet-agent-5.3.5-1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm<br>
 Puppet rpm is installed using rpm -i command line.<br>  
 After Puppet installation, path to puppet is /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet.<br>
 Please note that Puppet comes with its own ruby, you'll find it here after Puppet installation :<br> 
    "/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/ruby -version" returns "ruby 2.4.2p198 (2017-09-14 revision 59899)" 
  
### Setup aixautomation module
#### Clone into AIX_AUTOMATION_DIR directory 
 Module aixautomation needs to be installed into 
  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules, which is the install directory
  referred as <b>INST_DIR</b> below.<br>
 You can do this by performing:<br>  
   - (development) git clone https://github.com/aix-puppet/aixautomation.git<br> 
   - (official) git clone https://github.com/aixoss/aix-puppet.git<br>   
 into INST_DIR repository.
 This creates INST_DIR/aixautomation directory, which is referred as <b>AIX_AUTOMATION_DIR</b> 
  below. <br> 
 <b>All relative paths below are related to this AIX_AUTOMATION_DIR directory.</b><br>
#### ./manifests/init.pp file  
 All aixautomation module setups are done through the ./manifests/init.pp file.<br>
#### Prerequisites 
 As a prerequisites of aixautomation Puppet module, NIM configuration between NIM server
  (on which this Puppet module runs), and the LPARs (on which software maintenance 
  operations are performed) needs to be properly set : all LPARs which can either 
  not be accessible through a simple 'ping -c1 -w5 <lpar>' command or through a 
  simple 'c_rsh' command will be excluded from the list of targets on which 
  ./manifests/init.pp will be applied. <br>
     
 List of LPARs on which rules can be applied is retrieved through NIM server by 
  getting list of standalones.<br>
 For advanced users who know 'ruby' language : if this list of standalones 
  is too large, and to spare time, you can skip some standalones by manually 
  editing ./lib/factor/standalones.rb : search for 'To shorten 
  execution', and use the two samples of code which are provided, one sample 
  to work on white list, and one sample to work on black list.  
 
### What aixautomation module affects 
 This module requires available disk space to store updates downloaded from FixCentral, 
  and to store downloaded eFix. By default downloads are performed into '/tmp', but a 
  more appropriate file system definitely needs to be chosen and then set into 
  ./manifests/init.pp ('root' parameter of 'download' clause for AIX updates, and 'root' 
  parameter of 'fix' clause for efix).  
  File system on which downloads are performed is automatically increased (100 MB each 
  time) if necessary (if system allows).<br>
 This module will perform AIX software updates of your systems, and install (or remove) 
  eFix.  

### Beginning with aixautomation
 As far as 'update' operation are concerned :<br> 
  You can perform download operations from FixCentral (suma downloads) and build a NIM 
  lpp_source resource with results of downloads in a first separate step, then in a second
   step you can update LPARs using the NIM lpp_source resource which was downloaded.    
 As far as 'efix' operations are concerned :<br>
  You can perform all preparation steps without applying the efix ans see the results.<br>
  You can choose to apply efix later on.<br>
  You can remove all efix installed if necessary<br>
   
## Usage
### Sample of manifest : init.pp
 Some commented samples are provided in ./examples/init.pp, and should be 
  used as a starting point, to customize ./manifests/init.pp which is the manifest file
   used by the puppet apply command. 

### Logs
 The "Puppet.debug('message')" method is used in Puppet framework and as well in 
  aixautomation module and debug messages can only be seen with the use of Puppet 
  "--debug" flag on the command line.<br> 
 All other levels ("info", "warning", "error") are displayed without condition.<br>   
 These Puppet log messages are displayed on console output.<br> 
 You can redirect Puppet framework outputs to one file with the use of this option :  
  "--logdest=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/output/logs/logfile.txt" on 
  the command line. 
 
 AixAutomation logs (and only AixAutomation log, and not Puppet log) are generated into 
   ./output/logs/PuppetAixAutomation.log.<br>
  Up to 12 rotation log files of one 1 MB are kept : ./output/logs/PuppetAixAutomation.log.0
   to ./output/logs/PuppetAixAutomation.log.12<br>
  These logs does not depend from Puppet --debug flag on the command line, and you'll get them 
   in any case.
 
### Installation directory 
  As said already, aixautomation module is installed into /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules 
  (called INST_DIR) :<br> 
   /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/aixautomation (called AIXAUTOMATION_DIR), 
   and all relative paths in this README are relative to this AIXAUTOMATION_DIR directory.<br>
  The aixautomation module generates all outputs under this directory (under ./output), 
  except downloads of updates and ifixes which are performed under 'root' directories mentioned 
  into ./manifests/init.pp file, (ou have one 'root' parameter for 'download' and one 'root' directory 
  for 'fix').  
 
### Command line    
  You can test ./manifests/init.pp manifest by using following command lines :<br>
        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet apply \ 
          --noop --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules \
          -e "include aixautomation"<br>
     or apply it without debug messages : <br>
        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet apply \
          --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules \
          -e "include aixautomation"<br>
     or apply it with debug messages : <br>
        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet apply  --debug \ 
        --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules \
          -e "include aixautomation"<br>
     or apply it with debug message and Puppet logs into a file : <br>
        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet apply \ 
         --logdest=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/output/logs/PuppetApply.log \
         --debug --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules \
         -e "include aixautomation"<br>   
        Please note that if you use "--logdest" parameter, you won't see any output on the 
         command line as everything is redirected to log file.
            
## Reference
### Facters
 Specific aixautomation facters collect the necessary data enabling aixautomation module to run :<br> 
    - props : to have shared configuration properties.<br>
    - standalones : you'll find results on this factor into ./output/facter/standalones_kept.yml file, 
       and into ./output/facter/standalones_skipped.yml file. This 'standalones' facter takes some time at 
       the beginning of aixautomation module, but as explained above, you have the possibility to manage 
       white list or black list of standalones to shorten execution.<br>
    - (preparation for) vios  : you'll find results on this factor into ./output/facter/vios_kept.yml file, 
       and into ./output/facter/vios_skipped.yml file.<br> 
    - servicepacks : you'll find results on this factor into ./output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml file. If this 
       file does not exist when "Puppet apply" is launched, it is computed by automatically downloading 
       Suma metadata files, all Suma metadata files are temporarily downloaded under ./output/facter/suma, 
       but are removed at the end, when new ./output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml file is generated. 
       Please note that as part of this computing, metadata downloads are attempted for SP of each TL until 
       repeatedly errors occur, meaning that the last SP do not exist. Therefore it is normal to have errors 
       when we reach non-existing SP, this is the way which is used to go until last existing SP.  
        
    
 
### Custom types and providers
 Three custom type and their providers constitute the aixautomation module.<br>
 All custom types utilizations are documented into ./examples/init.pp<br>
 
 #### Custom type : download (provider : suma)
 ##### Explanations
 The aim of this provider is to provide download services using suma functionality.<br>
 Suma requests are generated so that updates are downloaded from Fix Central.<br>
 "root" parameter is used as download directory : it should be an ad-hoc file system dedicated to 
  download updates, keep this file system separated from the system so prevent saturation.<br>   
 At a preliminary step, suma <b>metadata</b> are downloaded if ever they are not locally 
  present into './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml' file : this file gives for each possible technical 
  level the list of available service packs.<br>
 You have as a reference a './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml.June_2018' delivered file which is the 
  file computed from Metadata in June 2018.<br>  
 Regularly, is a good practice to consider that the './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml' 
  is maybe not up-to-date, and therefore let 'suma' provider downloads metadata 'in live' 
  and compute a more recent version of './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml'. To perform this, you can 
  rename existing './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml' to './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml.saved' 
  so that this './output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml' is computed again. You should perform this operation 
  once in a while (every month or so).<br>
 Various types of suma downloads can be performed : either "SP", or "TL", or "Latest" :<br>
  - "SP" contains everything update system on a given Technical Level.<br>
  - "TL" contains everything to update system from a Technical Level to another 
    Technical Level.<br>
  - "Latest" contains everything to update system to the last Service Pack of a given 
    Technical Level.<br>
 As a result of suma download a lpp_source NIM resource is built. You can choose either 
  to name it (with your own way of naming), or let 'suma' provider name the lpp_source.
  Naming convention use "PAA" as a prefix to identify automatically lpp_source NIM resource
   as a shortcut for "<b>P</b>uppet<b>A</b>ix<b>A</b>utomation"'. Then the <type> of suma 
   download is used : "SP", "TL", "Latest", then the <from> and the <to> fields. As a example, 
   you would have : "PAA_SP_7100-03_7100-03-07-1614" indicating a NIM resource to update from 
   7.3.0 to 7.3.7.1614 SP.
 It is possible to perform only the suma 'preview' (and therefore not the suma 'download')
   by setting the 'to_step' parameter of the download custom type to 'preview'. By default, this
   'to_step' parameter is set to 'download', meaning that the suma download is performed. 
 One new parameter 'force' enables to force downloads of everything from scratch, even if 
   the results of downloads are available. Set this 'force' parameter to 'yes' to force 
   downloads again. In that case 'preview' is done only if explicitly required. 
   By default 'force is set to 'no', meaning all previous downloads are kept and reused, this 
   can spare a lot of time. <br>  
 You'll find samples of suma downloads into ./examples/init.pp.<br>
 ##### Parameters
 - <b>provider</b> : this parameter is not mandatory, if mentioned it needs to contain name of 
  the provider implementing the 'download' custom type, therefore the value needs to be : <b>suma</b>.  
 - <b>ensure</b> : to control flow of execution, this parameter can take two values, either 
  <b>present</b> or <b>absent</b>. By default <b>present</b> is assumed. 
  If set the <b>present</b>, suma command will be attempted so that what is set into parameters is 
   performed : suma downloads accrding to prameters values. <br> 
  If set to <b>absent</b>, result of previous <b>present</b> run is clean : NIM lpp_source resource 
   is cleaned, and results of suma downloads is removed from disks.     
 - <b>name</b> : not a mandatory property if you have only one 'download' clause in 
  ./manifests/init.pp. Otherwise (multiple 'download' clauses), this property is necessary  
   to uniquely identify the suma download to be performed : you can have several 'download' 
   clauses in ./manifests/init.pp, each of them being uniquely identified. 
 - <b>root</b> : root directory to store results of suma download. This root directory should reside 
   on a file system separated from the one which hosts the system itself, and preferably different from /tmp. 
   This root directory needs to be large enough to contain system updates, and should be a exportable file 
   system, so that NIM can build NIM lpp_source resource and perform a mount from the remote LPARs. 
   <i>Note : jfs jfs2 and others considerations to be added</i>  
 - <b>type</b> : type of suma downloads. Three possible values : <b>SP</b> to suma-download a service 
   pack, i.e. what allows you to update from a XXXX-YY technical level to any service packs of this 
   technical level. <b>TL</b> to suma-download a technical level, so that you system gets updated 
   to a new technical level. <b>Latest</b> to suma-download the last service pack of a given technical
    level. A last value is possible : <b>Meta</b> but is reserved for internal use.   
 - <b>from</b> : parameter used to launch suma-download command, indicating the starting level 
   of desired updates. For example by indicating <b>7100-01</b>, it means download contains everything 
   to update from this <b>7100-01</b> technical level, or by indicating <b>100-01-02-1150</b>, it 
   means download contains everything to update from this <b>7100-01-02-1150</b> service pack.
 - <b>to</b> : parameter used to launch suma-download command, indicating the level of updates 
   desired. For example by indicating <b>7100-03</b>, it means download contains everything to 
   update up to this <b>7100-03</b> technical level, or  by indicating <b>7100-01-08-1642</b>, it 
   means download contains everything to update up to this <b>7100-01-08-1642</b> service pack.
 - <b>lpp_source</b> : name of the NIM lpp_source resource built containing results of suma 
   downloads. If ever this lpp_source name is not provided, a naming convention is used to build 
   this name, by using a prefix ('PAA'), and by concatenating 'type', 'from', and 'to' parameters. 
   The name of this lpp_source is reused when performing updates of system (using 'nimpush' clause).  
 - <b>to_step</b> : to control flow of execution up to a given step. Two possible steps : 
   <b>preview</b> and <b>download</b>. By default, <b>download</b> is assumed. You can perform 
   only <b>preview</b> suma download, by setting this parameter to <b>preview</b>, in that case 
   download is not done.
 - <b>force</b> : to force suma download again. Two possible values for this parameter : 
   <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b>. By default, <b>no</b> is assumed, meaning that suma download won't be 
   done again if expected results of suma download can be found under <b>root</b> directory. 
   If set to <b>yes</b>, this parameter can force a new suma download (even if this suma download 
   was already done, and if it can be found under <b>root</b> directory) and can force the building 
   of a new NIM lpp_source resource (even if this NIM lpp_source resource already exists). 
 
 #### Custom type : patchmngt (provider : nimpush)
 ##### Explanations
 The aim of this provider is to provide software maintenance operations on a list of LPARs 
  using NIM push mode. Everything is performed from the NIM server on which this aixautomation 
  Puppet module runs.<br>   
 This NIM push mode can use suma downloads performed by suma provider, as preliminary step, 
  by using into 'lpp_source' parameter the lpp_source which was created by 'suma' provider.<br>
 Software maintenance operations include : install and updates.<br>
 You'll find samples of install and update into ./examples/init.pp.<br> 
 ##### Parameters
   - <b>provider</b> : this parameter is not mandatory, if mentioned it needs to contain name of 
   the provider implementing the 'patchmngt' custom type, therefore the value needs to be : 
   <b>nimpush</b>.  
   - <b>ensure</b> : to control flow of execution, this parameter can take two values, either 
   <b>present</b> or <b>absent</b>. By default <b>present</b> is assumed. 
   If set the <b>present</b>, nim push operation will be attempted so that what is set 
   into parameters is performed.<br>
   If set to <b>absent</b>,  <i> missing </i>.     
   - <b>name</b> : not a mandatory property if you have only one 'patchmngt' clause in 
   ./manifests/init.pp. Otherwise (multiple 'patchmngt' clauses), this property is necessary  
   to uniquely identify the nim push operation to be performed : you can have several 'patchmngt' 
   clauses in ./manifests/init.pp, each of them being uniquely identified.<br> 
  - <b>action</b> : action to be performed. This parameter can take several values : <b>install</b>, 
   <b>update</b>, <b>reboot</b>, <b>status</b>. By default, <b>status</b> is assumed.
   <b>install</b> action enables installation (or un-installation depending on the <b>ensure</b> value) 
   of a lpp_source, <b>update</b> action enables update of a system (installation of a service pack or 
   installation of a technical level), <b>reboot</b> action enables to launch reboot of LPARs. 
   <b>status</b> action displays version level and efix information related to LPARs.       
  - <b>lpp_source</b> : name of the NIM lpp_source resource to be installed/un-installed or which 
  needs to be used to performed system update. In case of update, this lpp_source is the one which 
  was built by a previous 'download' clause (results of suma downloads). 
  - <b>targets</b> : names of the LPARs on which to perform action.
  - <b>sync</b> : if action needs to be done synchronously or asynchronously. Two possible values for this 
  parameter : <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b>. By default, <b>no</b> is assumed.  
    
 #### Custom type : fix (provider : flrtvc)
 ##### Explanations
 The aim of this provider is to provide appropriate eFix installations using flrtvc 
  functionality to compute eFix to be installable, and NIM push functionality to install eFix.<br> 
 "root" parameter is used as download directory : it should be an ad-hoc file system dedicated to 
  download efix, keep this file system separated from the system so prevent saturation.<br>   
 List of appropriate eFix to be installed on a system is firstly computed by 'flrtvc', then checked
  against constraints and a short list of eFix of installable eFix is computed, a NIM resource 
  is then built and then applied, so that eFix are installed.<br>
 These several steps necessary to achieve this efix installation task, are performed 
  following this order : "installFlrtvc", "runFlrtvc", "parseFlrtvc", "downloadFixes", 
  "checkFixes", "buildResource", "installResource". <br>
 Executions can be stopped after any step, and this is controlled through the 'to_step' parameter 
  into ./manifests/init.pp.<br>
 Each step persists its results into a yaml file, which can be found into 
  ./output/flrtvc directory.<br> 
 All yaml files can be reused between two executions, to spare time if ever the external 
  conditions have not changed, this is controlled through the 'force' parameter which needs 
  then to be set to 'no'. By default it is set to 'yes', meaning the previously computed 
  yaml files are not used.<br>
 eFix are sorted by 'Packaging Date' before being applied, i.e. most recent first. It could 
  occur that one particular eFix prevents another one (less recent) from being installed if 
  they touch the same file.<br>
 At the end of execution of this provider, you'll find into : <br>
  - ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixInstall_<target>.yml : how were the <target> 
    LPAR before eFix installation.<br> 
  - ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixInstall_<target>.yml : how are the <target> 
    LPARs after eFix installation.<br>
  - ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixRemoval_<target>.yml : how were the <target> 
    LPAR before eFix de-installation.<br> 
  - ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixRemoval_<target>.yml : how are the <target> 
    LPARs after eFix de-installation.<br>
 ##### Parameters
   - <b>provider</b> : this parameter is not mandatory, if mentioned it needs to contain name of 
   the provider implementing the 'fix' custom type, therefore the value needs to be : 
   <b>flrtvc</b>.  
   - <b>ensure</b> : to control flow of execution, this parameter can take two values, either 
   <b>present</b> or <b>absent</b>. By default <b>present</b> is assumed. 
   If set the <b>present</b>, efix are installed by running all steps. If set to <b>absent</b>, 
   efix are removed.     
   - <b>name</b> : not a mandatory property if you have only one 'fix' clause in 
   ./manifests/init.pp. Otherwise (multiple 'fix' clauses), this property is necessary  
   to uniquely identify the flrtvc operation to be performed : you can have several 'fix' 
   clauses in ./manifests/init.pp, each of them being uniquely identified.<br> 
   - <b>to_step</b> : : to control flow of execution up to a given step. Possible values : 
   <b>installFlrtvc</b>, <b>runFlrtvc</b>, <b>parseFlrtvc</b>, <b>downloadFixes</b>, 
   <b>checkFixes</b>, <b>buildResource</b>, <b>installResource</b>. All these steps are 
   performed in the given order above, but you can interrupt execution after any given step, 
   by using this <b>to_step</b> parameter. <br>
   By default, <b>installResource</b> is assumed, meaning all steps are done.<br> 
   - <b>targets</b> : names of the LPARs on which to perform flrtvc steps.
   - <b>force</b>  : to force all flrtvc steps to be done again without exploiting any 
   persisted information. Two possible values for this parameter : <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b>. 
   By default, <b>yes</b> is assumed, meaning all previous results of any flrtvc runs (which are 
   persisted into yaml files) are not kept, and computed again. If ever you want to spare time, 
   and reuse previous flrtvc results, or if you want or run flrtvc step by step (refer to 
   <b>to_step</b> parameter), you can keep previous results by setting this parameter to <b>no</b>. 
   - <b>root</b> : root directory to store results of flrtvc download. This root directory should 
   reside on a file system separated from the one which hosts the system itself. This root 
   directory needs to be large enough to contain efix updates, and should be a exportable file 
   system, so that NIM can build NIM lpp_source resource and perform a mount from the remote LPARs.
   By default <b>/tmp</b> is assumed. 
   - <b>type</b> : type of desired efix. Possible values : <b>hiper</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>all</b>. By default,
   <b>all</b> is assumed, meaning all possible efix are installed.

    - fix custom type 'clean' parameter is changed to 'force' parameter
      If force is set to 'yes', all downloads are forced again, even if the downloads 
       existed before and were available. By default force is set to 'no', meaning we keep 
       everything.
  #### 0.5.6:
   Several bugs fixed : 
   - One status file per target is necessary, otherwise if several 'fix' clauses, then last one 
     overrides previous ones. Therefore we'll have these files 
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixInstall_<target>.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixRemoval_<target>.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixInstall_<target>.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixRemoval_<target>.yml<br>
   - Persistence of flrtvc information commmon to all targets into two files
       so that these files are taken as input at beginning of flrtvc processings
       (only if clean='no') : listoffixes_per_url.yml, lppminmax_of_fixes.yml      
   - 'nimpush' targets are now reset between each 'nimpush' clause info ./manifests/init.pp
      this was not the case previously, and brought a lot of confusion when several 'nimpush'
      clauses, applying on different sets of targets, existed into ./manifests/init.pp.
 #### 0.5.5:
   - Rubocop warnings removal 
 #### 0.5.4:
   - add status before and after ifix removal, as these status exist before and after ifix 
    installation. Commonnalize status output persistence into Flrtvc.step_status
    method.<br>
    These files can be found:<br> 
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixInstall.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusAfterEfixRemoval.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixInstall.yml<br>
     ./output/logs/PuppetAix_StatusBeforeEfixRemoval.yml<br>
   - better management of downloads : for example for timeout on ftp download, the failed urls
    are identified as being in failure, and are listed at the end of download phase. If you run
    flrtvc a second time, after a fist time which had download failures, only failed urls
    downloads are attempted.<br>
 #### 0.5.3:
   - validation messages of custom type contain contextual messages<br> 
   - move all outputs into ./output directory : logs are now into 
   ./output/logs, facter results are now into ./output/facter.<br>
 #### 0.5.2:
   - add 'to_step' parameter to "download" custom type, to control execution of the two steps 
    'suma preview' and 'suma download' separately. By setting 'to_step' to "preview", only 
    "preview" is performed. By default "download" is performed.<br> 
 #### 0.5.1:
   - fix the automatic installation of "/usr/bin/flrtvc.ksh" if this file is missing 
   - renaming of "./output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml" file to 
     "./output/facter/sp_per_tl.yml.June_2018", 
     so that this file is generated at least once after installation. This file contains
     the matches between Technical Levels and Service Packs for all releases.<br>   
 ### Debugguing tips
 Shell environments may cause errors with underlying (shell) system commands.  
 So, it may require an unset of the terminal environment before use. 
  (For example, if ever you have in your environment this variable set : 'ENV=/.kshrc', 
   this can lead to abnormal behaviour, not well explained. In that case, perform 
   'unset ENV' before retrying.)
