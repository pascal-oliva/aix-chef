#
# The baseline for module testing used by Puppet Inc. is that each manifest
#  should have a corresponding test manifest that declares that class or defined
#  type.
#
# Manifest init.pp contains all declarations to be applied on your systems.
# You can launch it, by using:
#    puppet apply --noop --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules -e "include aixautomation"
#  to check for compilation errors and view a log of events
# Or by fully applying the manifest in a real environment, by using:
#    puppet apply --debug --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules -e "include aixautomation"
#  to apply manifest and run it.
# Or by using:
#    puppet apply --debug \
#          --logdest=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/aixautomation/output/logs/Puppet.log \
#          --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules -e "include aixautomation"
#  to apply manifest and run it, keeping all logs into a file
#
# This examples.init.pp contains several samples of declarations with complete explanations
#  so that you can start from these samples and experiment.
#
# You can as well learn more about module testing here:
